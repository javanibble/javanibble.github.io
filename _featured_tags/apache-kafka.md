  Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It allows for the efficient, scalable, and fault-tolerant processing of large streams of data by enabling the publishing, subscribing, storing, and processing of messages in real time. Kafka is widely used for building high-throughput data systems, handling event-driven architectures, and integrating microservices with real-time data feeds.
