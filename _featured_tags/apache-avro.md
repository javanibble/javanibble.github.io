  Apache Avro is a framework for data serialisation, primarily used in big data processing systems like Apache Kafka and Hadoop. It provides a compact, fast, and efficient way to serialise data, ensuring interoperability between different programming languages. Avro uses JSON for defining data types and protocols, and stores data in a binary format, making it ideal for high-performance, schema-based data exchange in distributed systems. It also supports schema evolution, allowing data structures to evolve over time without breaking compatibility.
