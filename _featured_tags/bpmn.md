  Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 (BPMN 2.0) is a standardised graphical notation for modelling business processes, making them easy to understand for business users and executable by automation systems. It uses symbols like events, activities, and gateways to represent the flow and logic of processes in a clear and structured way.

## What is BPMN?
> "Business Process Model and Notation has become the de-facto standard for business processes diagrams. It is intended
> to be used directly by the stakeholders who design, manage and realize business processes, but at the same time be
> precise enough to allow BPMN diagrams to be translated into software process components. BPMN has an easy-to-use
> flowchart-like notation that is independent of any particular implementation environment." ~ [BPMN Specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/)
