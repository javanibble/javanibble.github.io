The BPMN Lane article focus on the definition and usage of the lane element as documented in the BPMN 2.0
specification. The example process diagram illustrates the correct use of the lane annotation. The BPMN Guidelines
section contains a detailed set of rules that apply to the lane and explains how the element may or may not be used
within the different BPMN diagrams.

## What is a Lane?
> "A partition that is used to organize and categorize activities within a Pool. A Lane extends the entire length of 
> the Pool either vertically or horizontally. Lanes are often used for such things as internal roles (e.g., Manager, 
> Associate), systems (e.g., an enterprise application), or an internal department (e.g., shipping, finance)." ~ [BPMN Specification][1]

## BPMN Notation
The BPMN specification defines the Lane element using the following description and notation:

| Element | Description | Notation |
|---------|-------------|:--------:|
| Lane | A Lane is a sub-partition within a Process, sometimes within a Pool, and will extend the entire length of the Process, either vertically or horizontally. Lanes are used to organize and categorize Activities. | <iconify-icon height=48px data-icon="bpmn:lane-divide-two"></iconify-icon> |
