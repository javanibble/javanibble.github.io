## What is a Reference Card?
A reference card is a concise bundling of condensed notes about a specific topic, such as common syntactic rules and 
idioms of a particular computer platform, application program, or formal language. It serves as an ad hoc memory aid 
for an experienced user.

A reference card is also known as a reference sheet, quick reference card, crib sheet or a cheat sheet.
