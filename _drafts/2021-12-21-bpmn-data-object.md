The BPMN Data Object article focus on the definition and usage of the data object element as documented in the BPMN 2.0
specification. The example process diagram illustrates the correct use of the data object annotation. The BPMN Guidelines
section contains a detailed set of rules that apply to the data object and explains how the element may or may not be used
within the different BPMN diagrams.

## What is a Data Object?
> "Data Objects provide information about what Activities require to be performed and/or what they produce, Data Objects 
> can represent a singular object or a collection of objects. Data Input and Data Output provide the same information 
> for Processes." ~ [BPMN Specification][1]

## BPMN Notation
The BPMN specification defines the Data Object element using the following description and notation:

| Element | Description | Notation |
|---------|-------------|:--------:|
| Data Object | Data Objects provide information about what Activities require to be performed and/or what they produce, Data Objects can represent a singular object or a collection of objects. | <iconify-icon height=48px data-icon="bpmn:data-object"></iconify-icon> |
