The BPMN Business Rule Task article focus on the definition and usage of the business rule task element as documented in 
the BPMN 2.0 specification. The example process diagram illustrates the correct use of the business rule task. The BPMN
Guidelines section contains a detailed set of rules that apply to the business rule task and explains how the element 
may or may not be used within the different BPMN diagrams.
