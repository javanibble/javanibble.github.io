The BPMN Data Input article focus on the definition and usage of the data input element as documented in the BPMN 2.0
specification. The example process diagram illustrates the correct use of the data input annotation. The BPMN Guidelines
section contains a detailed set of rules that apply to the data input and explains how the element may or may not be used
within the different BPMN diagrams.
