The BPMN Manual Task article focus on the definition and usage of the manual task element as documented in the BPMN 2.0 
specification. The example process diagram illustrates the correct use of the manual task. The BPMN Guidelines section 
contains a detailed set of rules that apply to the manual task and explains how the element may or may not be used 
within the different BPMN diagrams.
