The BPMN Service Task article focus on the definition and usage of the service task element as documented in the BPMN 2.0
specification. The example process diagram illustrates the correct use of the service task. The BPMN Guidelines section
contains a detailed set of rules that apply to the service task and explains how the element may or may not be used
within the different BPMN diagrams.
