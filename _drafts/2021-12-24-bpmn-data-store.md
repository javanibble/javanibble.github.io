The BPMN Data Store article focus on the definition and usage of the data object store as documented in the BPMN 2.0
specification. The example process diagram illustrates the correct use of the data store annotation. The BPMN Guidelines
section contains a detailed set of rules that apply to the data store and explains how the element may or may not be used
within the different BPMN diagrams.

## What is a Data Store?
