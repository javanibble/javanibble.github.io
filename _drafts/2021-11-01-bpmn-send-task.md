The BPMN Send Task article focus on the definition and usage of the send task element as documented in the BPMN 2.0
specification. The example process diagram illustrates the correct use of the send task. The BPMN Guidelines section
contains a detailed set of rules that apply to the send task and explains how the element may or may not be used
within the different BPMN diagrams.

## What is a Send Task?

> Once the Message has been sent, the Task is completed." ~ [BPMN Specification][1]

## BPMN Notation
