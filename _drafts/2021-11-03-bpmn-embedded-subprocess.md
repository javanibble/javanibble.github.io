The BPMN Embedded Subprocess article focus on the definition and usage of the embedded subprocess element as documented 
in the BPMN 2.0 specification. The example process diagram illustrates the correct use of the embedded subprocess. The 
BPMN Guidelines section contains a detailed set of rules that apply to the embedded subprocess and explains how the 
element may or may not be used within the different BPMN diagrams.
