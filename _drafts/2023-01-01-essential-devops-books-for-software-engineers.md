<p>The first thing Jez Humble and David Farley do is lay out the principles of a quick, dependable, low-risk delivery procedure. The "deployment pipeline," an automated mechanism for handling all changes from check-in to release, is then introduced. They then talk about the "environment" required to support continuous delivery, including governance, infrastructure, data, and configuration management.</p>

<p>The productivity advantage is so significant that larger companies with tightly coupled architectures recognise they must adopt DevOps or risk falling behind. The most critical issue is that their traditional architectures involve coordinating the creation, testing, and deployment of code across hundreds of employees; thus, they are unable to allow small teams to work independently.</p>
