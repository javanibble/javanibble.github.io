The BPMN Data Output article focus on the definition and usage of the data output element as documented in the BPMN 2.0
specification. The example process diagram illustrates the correct use of the data output annotation. The BPMN Guidelines
section contains a detailed set of rules that apply to the data output and explains how the element may or may not be used
within the different BPMN diagrams.
