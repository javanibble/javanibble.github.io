The BPMN Pool article focus on the definition and usage of the pool element as documented in the BPMN 2.0
specification. The example process diagram illustrates the correct use of the pool annotation. The BPMN Guidelines
section contains a detailed set of rules that apply to the pool and explains how the element may or may not be used
within the different BPMN diagrams.

## What is a Pool?
> "A Pool represents a Participant in a Collaboration. Graphically, a Pool is a container for partitioning a Process 
> from other Pools/Participants. A Pool is not required to contain a Process, i.e., it can be a “black box.”" ~ [BPMN Specification][1]

## BPMN Notation
The BPMN specification defines the Pool element using the following description and notation:

| Element | Description | Notation |
|---------|-------------|:--------:|
| Pool | A Pool is the graphical representation of a Participant in a Collaboration. It also acts as a “swimlane” and a graphical container for partitioning a set of Activities from other Pools. A Pool MAY have internal details, in the form of the Process that will be executed. Or a Pool MAY have no internal details, i.e., it can be a "black box." | <iconify-icon height=48px data-icon="bpmn:participant"></iconify-icon> |
