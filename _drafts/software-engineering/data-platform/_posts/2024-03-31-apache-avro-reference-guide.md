## What is Apache Avro?
Apache Avroâ„¢ is a robust **_data serialisation framework_** that facilitates the **_exchange of data_** between programs
written in any language.

* Provides a container file for storing persistent data.
* Supports efficient data serialisation and deserialisation.
* Enables remote procedure calls (RPC) for seamless service interaction in distributed environments.
* Offers simple integration with dynamic languages without requiring code generation.
