The BPMN Script Task article focus on the definition and usage of the script task element as documented in the BPMN 2.0
specification. The example process diagram illustrates the correct use of the script task. The BPMN Guidelines section
contains a detailed set of rules that apply to the script task and explains how the element may or may not be used
within the different BPMN diagrams.

## What is a Script Task?
> "A Script Task is executed by a business process engine. The modeler or implementer defines a script in a language 
> that the engine can interpret. When the task is ready to start, the engine will execute the script. When the script is 
> completed, the task will also be completed." ~ [BPMN Specification][1]

## BPMN Notation
The BPMN specification defines the Script Task element using the following description and notation:

| Element | Description | Notation |
|---------|-------------|:--------:|
| Script Task | A Script Task is executed by a business process engine. The modeler or implementer defines a script in a language that the engine can interpret. When the Task is ready to start, the engine will execute the script. When the script is completed, the Task will also be completed. | <iconify-icon height=48px data-icon="bpmn:script-task"></iconify-icon> |
