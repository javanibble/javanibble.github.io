The BPMN 2.0 Ultimate Reference contains information about the different types of BPMN diagrams together with the set of
elements used during the modelling process. This also serves as a reference to understand the different bpmn elements, 
types and guidelines on each of the elements.

## What is BPMN?
> "Business Process Model and Notation has become the de-facto standard for business processes diagrams. It is intended 
> to be used directly by the stakeholders who design, manage and realize business processes, but at the same time be 
> precise enough to allow BPMN diagrams to be translated into software process components. BPMN has an easy-to-use 
> flowchart-like notation that is independent of any particular implementation environment." ~ [BPMN Specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0.2/)

## BPMN 2.0 Diagrams
The BPMN 2.0 (Business Process Model and Notation) specification defines several types of diagrams to model business processes, with a focus on improving communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders. The main types of diagrams in BPMN 2.0 are:

* [Process Diagram](/bpmn-diagrams#process-diagram)
* [Collaboration Diagram](/bpmn-diagrams#collaboration-diagram)
* [Conversation Diagram](bpmn-diagrams#conversation-diagram)
* [Choreography Diagram](/bpmn-diagrams#choreography-diagram)


## BPMN 2.0 Elements
BPMN 2.0 elements are the building blocks used to create standardised visual representations of business processes. These elements are categorized into five main types: 

* [Flow Objects](/bpmn-elements/#flow-objects) (events, activities, and gateways)
* [Data](/bpmn-elements/#data) (objects, inputs, outputs, stores)
* [Connecting Objects](/bpmn-elements/#connecting-objects) (sequence flows, message flows, and associations) 
* [Swimlanes](/bpmn-elements/#swimlanes) (pools and lanes) 
* [Artifacts](/bpmn-elements/#artifacts) (groups, and annotations)


## BPMN  Specifications
Originally developed by the Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI), BPMN has been maintained by the Object Management Group (OMG) since the two organizations merged in 2005. Version 2.0 of BPMN was released in January 2011. Business Process Model and Notation has become the de-facto standard for business processes diagrams.

## What is DMN?
> "The purpose of DMN is to provide the constructs that are needed to model decisions, so that organizational 
> decision- making can be readily depicted in diagrams, accurately defined by business analysts, and (optionally)
> automated." ~ [DMN Specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.3/PDF) 


## DMN Specifications
There are a number of versions of the DMN specification: 

* **DMN 1.3 Specification**: [https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.3/](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.3/)
* **DMN 1.2 Specification**: [https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.2/](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.2/)
* **DMN 1.1 Specification**: [https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.1/](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/1.1/)
