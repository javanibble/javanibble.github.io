## BPMN  Specifications
Originally developed by the Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI), BPMN has been maintained by the Object Management Group (OMG) since the two organizations merged in 2005. Version 2.0 of BPMN was released in January 2011. Business Process Model and Notation has become the de-facto standard for business processes diagrams.
