  Containerisation is a technology that allows developers to package an application and its dependencies together into a single unit, called a container. These containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent across environments, making it easier to develop, deploy, and scale applications. Unlike virtual machines (VMs), containers share the host operating system's kernel but operate in isolated user spaces, making them more efficient.
